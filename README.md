# ROS 2 Tutorial
## What is ROS 2? Why should I use it?
ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the next generation of the original ROS, designed to address the limitations of ROS 1 and make it more suitable for modern robotics applications. Here are some key benefits of using ROS 2:

- Enhanced Modularity: Similar to ROS 1, ROS 2 allows you to develop different robot components separately, such as sensing, control, and actuation systems, which helps manage complexity.
- Multi-Language Support: ROS 2 supports C++, Python, and other languages, allowing you to leverage the strengths of each.
- Real-Time Capabilities: ROS 2 is designed to support real-time systems, making it suitable for critical robotics applications that require precise timing and control.
- Improved Security: ROS 2 incorporates better security features, which are essential for robotics applications in sensitive environments.
- Support for DDS (Data Distribution Service): DDS is the backbone of ROS 2, allowing for efficient communication across different platforms and devices, including distributed systems.
- Cross-Platform Support: ROS 2 works on Linux and Windows allowing developers to choose their preferred operating system.

ROS 2 is widely used in industry and research because of its flexibility, scalability, and ability to integrate with modern robotic hardware and software.

# Tutorial Requirements
To comfortably understand this tutorial, you should be familiar with basic command line operations, including navigating directories with cd and executing commands. Knowledge of package management and basic software development principles will also be beneficial.

## Optional but helpful skills include:
- Solid Programming Skills: Proficiency in Python will make it easier to develop ROS 2 nodes and debug code.
- Basic Networking Knowledge: Understanding how networks work will help when working with distributed ROS 2 systems.
- Stable Internet Connection: Essential for downloading packages, updates, and dependencies.
  
You can run ROS 2 directly on Linux, Windows, or macOS, or you can use Docker for a more isolated environment. Installation guides are available on the official ROS 2 website, and you can find detailed instructions for your operating system there.

## More Resources
ROS 2 includes powerful features like actions, nodes, topics, services, parameters, logging, and the ability to operate across multiple devices. To learn more about these capabilities, the official ROS 2 documentation and tutorials are a great place to start: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html. Happy coding with ROS 2!
